# PetsAlone Technical Assesment

Picture the scene…you’ve tuned into your favourite show on Netflix ready to relax for the evening…and the phone rings…

It transpires that your friend, Bill, has lost his beloved pet – a rare breed Norwegian Forest Cat. In fact it’s been about 48 hours and Bill is rather distressed.

Thankfully Bill hasn’t asked you to go out searching on foot. However, knowing that you’re a keen technologist, he asks if you could help him out in a different way. He has had an idea of creating a web-based system to help owners raise awareness of their missing pets.

Bill has come up with a name (which he’s very proud of) ‘PetsAlone’, and he has also given you a head-start and made it available on GitHub, which you can clone and then modify to meet his requirements… You begrudgingly agree to help, knowing that Bill isn’t an accomplished developer, but he’s in a desperate situation and you want to help out. You manage to get some high-level requirements from Bill before he hangs up...


### User stories

As an anonymous user  
I want to see all missing pets  
So that I can help to reunite a missing pet with its owner.  

As an authenticated user  
I want to create a new missing pet on the system  
So that I can raise awareness of a missing pet.

### Assessment Acceptance criteria

1.  The home page of the site will show all the missing pets, with the most recently added pets listed first
2.  A user will be able to filter the pets that have gone missing by animal type (dog, cat, ferret etc)
3.  A new page, only accessible by an authenticated user, which will be able to create a new missing pet. Bill has created a model to use in PetsAlone.Core/Pet.cs
4.  A developer picking up the project after you should see some evidence of you testing the code, even if it only covers a few key scenarios

### To help save you some time...

-   The ‘PetsAlone.Core’ project found in this GitHub repo contains a service with some existing methods to get you started. It interacts with an in-memory database which can be used in this exercise in place of a ‘real’ database. 

-   This project also contains a mocked identity provider which can be used to simulate logging in. For an authenticated user you can log in with the following credentials:  
Username: elmyraduff  
Password: MontanaMax!!

-	You’ll find ‘boilerplate’ projects for React, MVC Razor and Angular in the repo as well (look inside the 'web' folder'). Feel free to use one of these to get you started on the frontend, but if you’d prefer to start from scratch (or use a different technology or framework) that’s also fine. Remember - Bill is not an experienced developer, so don't be shy about changing or removing anything that you don't need.

-	Bill needs this app live ASAP, so aim to spend only a couple of hours on this. 

### Running the app
Ensure you have .net core 3.1 installed on your machine. If you're using Visual Studio 2019 then set one of the web projects as the startup project and hit run.

### **Project Design Overview**
1. Frontend: Angular Application
-Structure
--Feature Module: create-pet
--Component: CreatePetComponent
--Handles the UI and user interactions for creating a new pet.
--Uses a form to collect pet details from the user.
--Service: PetService
--Handles HTTP communication with the backend API for pet-related operations.
-PetService Responsibilities
--getAllPets(petType?: number):
--Fetches a list of all pets, optionally filtered by pet type.
--Sends a GET request to /api/pets/all with optional query parameters.
--createPet(pet: any):
--Sends a POST request to /api/pets/create to add a new pet.
--Intended to include an authorization token in the header (currently commented out).
-Authentication
--The service retrieves a token from localStorage (key: currentUser) for authenticated requests.
--The code for adding the Authorization header is present but commented out.

2. Backend: .NET Core 3.1 API
API Endpoints:
GET /api/pets/all — Returns all pets, supports filtering by type.
POST /api/pets/create — Creates a new pet entry.
Authentication:
Expected to use JWT Bearer tokens for protected endpoints (as inferred from the commented code).

3. Data Flow
-User Action: User fills out the pet creation form in the Angular app.
-Component Logic: CreatePetComponent collects form data and calls PetService.createPet().
-Service Call: PetService sends a POST request to the backend API.
-Backend Processing: .NET Core API receives the request, authenticates (if required), and processes the pet creation.
-Response: API returns a success or error response, which is handled by the Angular component.

[CreatePetComponent] --(createPet)--> [PetService] --(POST)--> [API: /api/pets/create]
  ^

[HomeComponent] --(getAllPets)--> [PetService] --(GET)--> [API: /api/pets/all]

4. Security Considerations
-Token Handling: The token should be included in the Authorization header for protected API calls.
-CORS: The backend should allow requests from the Angular frontend origin.
